# AtkinsScorekeeper
A homemade scoreboard for Academic Team matches

## Installation
1. Download the binary zip file from the latest releases page
2. Extract the zip file to any directory as long as the `Prefs.dat` file and the `AHSTrivia.jar` file stay together
3. Open the `Prefs.dat` file to edit team names (will add future ability for background images)
4. Double click the `AHSTrivia.jar` and select the teams that will be playing the match and click the "Select Teams" button
5. The full screen scoreboard should now show (in some cases the window needs to be maximized to fill entire screen)
